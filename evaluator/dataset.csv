However, being fast was not the only\nrequirement, they also needed to build scalable and reliable systems.\nAddressing these technical issues, Giri shared that the team adopted modern\ncloud native technologies that could address the issues at scale, such as\nmicroservices, containers, Kubernetes and service mesh.\n“We did achieve the scale and reliability, but our infrastructure was becoming\nincreasingly more complex for developers who weren’t familiar with this\nlayer of technology, and ultimately slowed down our collective developer\nvelocity.”\nHe added that the cloud native adoption also required the developer teams to\nperform major infrastructure migration — multiple times. “Developers who\nwere supposed to deliver features to end customers had to deal with these\nunnecessary tasks. [...] When developers were not able to spend most of their\ntime writing codes for customers, it did not just affect their productivity but\nalso morale. Because they believed in tech for good, in making a lasting\nimpact on people.”\nGiovanni further stated that the risk of the company’s exponential growth\nwas that each of the tech leads would make decisions in silo. “With rapid\ngrowth, requirements pour in, so each tech lead would have to make decisions\non their own,” he said.\n\uf1e0\n\uf39e \uf099 \uf0e1\nGoPay.sh: A glimpse into Indonesia’s leading e-wallet GoPay’s Develo... https://www.thejakartapost.com/adv-longform/2022/06/16/gopay-sh-a-...\n2 of 5 20/11/25, 14.28']","GoTo Financial addressed technical challenges in scaling their ecosystem by adopting cloud-native technologies such as microservices, containers, Kubernetes, and service mesh to achieve scalability and reliability.
